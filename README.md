# Octave Game Framework

This is my first real big pet project. Having dabbled in this type of work frequently and using commercial engines like Unity and Unreal for years, I've decided to learn how the sauce is made.

Octave is not intended to compete with any commercial or non-commercial game engines, but rather exists as a research project for myself to learn and grow my skillset.

## General Project Goals
- Create a collection of code and tools for creating 3D games
- Focus on use of "Standard C++" (C++17) for easy knowledge transfer
- Focus on cross-platform (Windows and Linux initially)
